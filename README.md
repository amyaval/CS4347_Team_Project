Run `source normalize.sql` in mysql to create the DB and tables.

Additionally I wrote a simple script to create the DB, tables, and output the required .csv files, though yall don't need to run it. I just also included it here incase the grader wonders how we generated our .csv files.

If yall want to try it then do

```console
./Create_DB_CSVs.sh
```

if you can't execute the script then run `chmod +x Create_DB_CSVs.sh` before trying again. 

And yes it's not the most secure script but wtv.
